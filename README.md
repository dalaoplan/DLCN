## 🧠 Dataset: DCLN

**DCLN (Dynamic-lighting Conditions at Night)** is a dataset collected specifically for rPPG signal evaluation under complex lighting environments.

### ✅ Key Features

- **60 volunteers**, each recorded under 4 lighting setups:
  1. Fixed intensity and fixed position
  2. Varying intensity and fixed position
  3. Fixed intensity and moving position
  4. Varying intensity and moving position
- **480 video samples**, covering both **rest** and **post-exercise** states
- Captured in a **darkroom** with synchronized physiological signal acquisition

> 💾 File Format: `.h5`  
> 🗂 Naming Convention: `P1_1` ~ `P60_8`
